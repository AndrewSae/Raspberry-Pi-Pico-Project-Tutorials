## FAQ

#### What will I learn?

You will learn how to properly use the Pi Pico to interface with displays, leds, buttons, servos, and various sensors. 

#### What will I need to complete the projects?

You will most definitely need a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller board, breadboard, hookup wire, a few buttons, resistors, leds, and a will to learn something new.

#### What is included in the project tutorials?

For every project there is a section on how to set up the circuit that is needed for that project and a code explanation to help you understand how the code works and to help you become confident enough to make your own projects.
